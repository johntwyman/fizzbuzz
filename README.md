# FizzBuzz Coding Kata

## Introduction

Coding katas are small exercises designed to help strengthen different coding skills.
The FizzBuzz kata is a classic kata intended to step developers through Test Driven Development
practices and think about concepts like the Keep It Simple Stupid and code refactoring.

## Setup

This repository requires [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) to setup.

With both dependencies installed, type `yarn install` to initialize the repository.

## The Problem

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 (via `console.log`).

- For multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number.
- For multiples of five print "Buzz" instead of the number.
- For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".

## How to tackle the solution

This exercise is not really about the solution, so much as the progress towards it. In working
on this exercise, bear in mind these key principles:

- Do one thing at a time; think incrementally
- Write your tests first
- Write the least amount of code to make your tests pass
